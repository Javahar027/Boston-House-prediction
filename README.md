# Boston-House-prediction

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Boston’s suburbs.
Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Boston’s area.
A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a dayly basis.

5. NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
9. RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
10.TAX full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 USD
